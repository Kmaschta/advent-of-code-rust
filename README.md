This repository is a way for me to learn Rust (and having fun!) by challenging myself with the [Advent of Code 2019](https://adventofcode.com)

Each day, if I can, I'll open a PR with the code I wrote to find the answers of the daily puzzle.

From here, you'll be able to see my progression. Be gentle, it's the first time I'm trying Rust! Any advice are welcome.

## How to use this repository

Each folder is a Rust program intended to solve a daily [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) puzzle.

On each of them, you'll find a few command allowing you to run common operation:

```bash
make install # or cargo update
make build # or cargo build
make run # or cargo run (with the input as an option)
make test # or cargo test
```

In order to run them, you'll need to install **Rust** and **Cargo** (follow the [_Installation_ chapter of the Rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-01-installation.html))
